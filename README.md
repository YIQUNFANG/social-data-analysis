# social-data-analysis

### Introduction
I focused on a small (1500 row / 20 column) sample of The Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS)​, including information on height and weight, smoking, alcohol consumption, general health, socio-demographics, income, and labour force characteristics of the population. This project explore the relationship between age and perceived physical health, and the correlation between age and perceived amount of daily stress.
